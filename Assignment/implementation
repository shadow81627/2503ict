I used lab4 task4 to create the navigation bar which has a home button in the 
top left, create post and display post with the laravel framework as the home 
page for the web application. 

The posts are displayed in most recent to least recent. Each post has a icon, 
title, message and username. The posts display the number of comments they have. 

The posts have edit, delete and view comments links. The edit button links to 
the edit page which has a form for editing a contact and has a cancel button 
which takes you back to the home page. When the update button is pressed the 
page redirects to the post detials page.

The view comments button takes you to a new page and displays all of the 
comments for that post and allows you take make new comments.


11. The view comments page should contain a form to add a new comment to the post.
13. Comments have a delete button but no edit button. Deleting a comment should redirect to the
view comments page.
