I used lab4 task4 to create the navigation bar, create post and display post 
with the laravel framework as the home page for the web application. The posts 
are displayed in most recent to least recent. Each post has a icon, title, 
message and username. The posts display the humber of comments they have. 



7. Each post should have edit and delete buttons or links.
8. Each post should have a view comments link.
9. When the edit button is pressed an edit page should be displayed which presents a form to edit
the contents of the post. A cancel button on this page simply redirects back to the home page
without any changes. A save button, updates the post and redirects to the view comments page.
10. When the view comments link is pressed, a new page (the view comments page) is displayed
showing the post as well as all of the comments.
11. The view comments page should contain a form to add a new comment to the post.
12. Comments have a message and a user, but no title.
13. Comments have a delete button but no edit button. Deleting a comment should redirect to the
view comments page.
14. This assignment must be implemented using Laravel and the DB class.
Good coding practice is expected. This includes:
- Naming: using consistent, readable, and descriptive names for files
